  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Redpanda Keeper (rpk) is Redpanda's command line interface (CLI)
      utility. The rpk commands let you configure, manage, and tune
      Redpanda clusters. They also let you manage topics, groups,
      and access control lists (ACLs).
      Start a three-node docker cluster locally:

          rpk container start -n 3

      Interact with the cluster using commands like:

          rpk topic list

      When done, stop and delete the docker cluster:

          rpk container purge
